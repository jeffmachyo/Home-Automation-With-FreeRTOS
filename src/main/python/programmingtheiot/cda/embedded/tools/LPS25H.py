# 
# This class is part of the Programming the Internet of Things project. 
# It is used to facilitate communication to the LPS25H microcontroller via I2C. 
# and is licensed under the MIT License. 
# It uses the Python smbus library to access the Raspberry Pi peripherals.
# The LPS25H is an ultra compact piezoresistive pressure sensor that is 
# used for temperature and pressure sensing. Its sensing element consists of a 
# suspended membrane realized inside a single mono-silicon substrate and is 
# manufactured by ST. It has a temperature range of -30 to +105 degrees C as
# well as a pressure operating range of 200 - 260 hPa.
# Specific details of the LPS25H may be found on the LPS25H datasheet.
